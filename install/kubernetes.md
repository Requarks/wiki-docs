# Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm)
- PostgreSQL Database

# Important

- **You must deploy a single instance in order to setup the application.** Once setup is completed, you can increase the number of replicas to any amount.
- Even though Wiki.js supports other database engines, using **PostgreSQL is a requirement** for multiple replicas.

# Install the Helm Chart
